title: Tomb of RNGesus update 0.1.0
---


So, I wasn't really happy with the way 7DRL turned out this year, but I'm too stubborn to give up on the idea of the game, so I'm continuing to work on it a bit. Today I'm releasing the first major update.

Since the first release I've added quite a few things, for example:
 
* **Weapons:** There are now 5 different weapon types. Different weapon types have different accuracies, critical hit chances, and damages. In the future I may differentiate the weapons more, perhaps by making some weapons take multiple turns to attack, or attack multiple spaces at once.
* **Runes:** Most weapons now have "Runes" (which are essentially the same as the Runes in Brogue). A runic weapon will have a special effect whenever attacking an enemy. For instance, Weapons of Ignition will ignite enemies, Weapons of Halting will prevent all enemies from moving on the turn they are used, Weapons of Contingency will deal half damage upon missing an attack, etc.
* **Arrows:** There are new types of arrows, each of which correspond to a rune.
* **More Enemies:** In the 7DRL version there were 7 enemies; there are now 14.
* **BALANCE:** This is a really imporant one. I was working on adding content up until the last day that I had any time to work on the game during the original week, so I didn't really have any time to balance the game, and this has been one of the biggest complaints about the game I've gotten. Truthfully I've never even beaten the 7DRL build of this game and I don't know whether or not it's really conceivable to do so. The game is still a work in progress, so the balance isn't perfect, but its miles ahead of the first version.
* **Ability Use:** Instead of charging, abilities now just have a limited number of uses per level. I think this is a lot more interesting. You can also now have 5 abilities instead of just 3.
* **Smaller Map:** Levels are now 30x30 instead of 45x45. This was done for balancing reasons, and simply making the tiles easier to see and understand (which was another complaint I got about the 7DRL version)
* **Graphical Improvements:** Instead of being static tiles, enemies now have idle animation cycles, and some basic damage-taking animations. In the future I will likely expand upon these animations. Also, enemies now slide between positions instead of moving instantly.

I'm still working on balancing combat, and there will likely be big changes by the next release. After I get that where I want it I'm going to add some environmental features for the player and enemies to interact with, mutations for enemies, a boss fight, possibly some sort of potions or scrolls, and of course a massive amount of graphical improvements.

Anyways, the game is available for download [here on itch.io](http://bunnyhopgames.itch.io/RNGesus). Let me know what you think in the comments!
