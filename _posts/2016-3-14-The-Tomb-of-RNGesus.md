For the 2016 7DRL competition this year I've created a game called "The Tomb of RNGesus."

The core mechanic of this game is the ability to see whether your attack will be a miss, hit, or critical hit before you actually take the attack. In fact, you can actually see your 5 next moves, as well as being able to see the next 3 moves of all enemies.

Personally, I think the game turned out pretty well, although I didn't get quite as much done as I would have liked. I might take a bit of time off of my main games to focus on updating this game, I'm not quite sure yet.

Anyways, the game is playable [here](https://bunnyhopgames.itch.io/the-tomb-of-rngesus). Hope you enjoy it!
