title: Welcome to the Bunnyhop Games blog!

Welcome to the blog! Bunnyhop games is currently a one-man development team. Right now, I'm working 

Right now, I'm working on two games: A traditional Roguelike focused on simplicity and elegance, and one rogue-lite strategy game.

Neither game is really in a playable state yet, but as soon as I get an early build up and ready to play I'll post a link somewhere on this blog.

In the past I've made a couple of games, all of which are available on my [Itch page](https://bunnyhopgames.itch.io). The ones that are worth playing are [Shoot the Red Square](https://bunnyhopgames.itch.io/shoot-the-red-square), a bullet-hell game I built for the Mini Ludum Dare 62, and [The tomb of RNGesus](https://bunnyhopgames.itch.io/the-tomb-of-rngesus), a roguelike made for the 2016 7DRL.
